## How to Deploy

2. Deploy your Supabase DB. Follow the instructions here: [Supabase Setup and Usage Guide](blog/database)

3. Deploy your NextJS project with your preferred cloud provider.

4. Deploy your Deno edge server. Follow the instructions here: [Deno Server Setup and Usage Guide](blog/edge-server)

5. Setup your ESP32 Arduino device. Follow the instructions here: [ESP32 Arduino Device Setup and Usage Guide](blog/firmware)

6. Putting it all together. Now you should have all the individual parts working together. 

7. For a single device, you can do not need to configure any device code settings on Supabase. For multiple devices, refer to the [Multiple Devices](blog/multiple-devices) guide.


## Advanced Config

1. Add your Deno and Vercel server Root CA to `Config.cpp`. You can find the Root CA of vercel by running the following command and picking the Root certificate in the chain:

```bash
# vercel server root ca
openssl s_client -showcerts -connect <your-vercel-deomain>.vercel.app:443 </dev/null

# deno server root ca
openssl s_client -showcerts -connect <your-deno-domain>.deno.dev:443 </dev/null
```

2. Edit `Config.cpp` to customize:
   - Server addresses and ports
   - Audio sample rate (default 24kHz)
   - Pin assignments for different boards

3. To deploy to production, comment out `#define DEV_MODE` and set the proper server addresses and ports.

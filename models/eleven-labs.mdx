ElevenLabs lets you build high-quality realtime voice agents and bring your custom voices to Elato. To use ElevenLabs on your ESP32, set your `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` in the `.env` file in your Deno server.

When bringing a character from Eleven Labs, add a character name and `Agent Id` (with prefix `agent_*`) from Eleven Labs' Agents Platform. Head to `Create` > `+ Eleven Labs Agent`:

<Tip>
Make sure your TTS output frequency is 24KHz in the `Voice` tab of your newly created agent's dashboard. This will match with the output frequency your ESP32 expects.
